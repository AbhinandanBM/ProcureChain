# ProcureChain

This project aims to develop a secure, transparent, and decentralized e-tendering system using blockchain technology. The system allows tendering organizations and vendors to publish and bid on tenders in a fair and open manner, without the risk of data manipulation, fraud, or favoritism. The system also employs encryption and hashing techniques to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the tender documents and bids.

## Features
Tendering organizations can create and manage tender notifications, view and evaluate bids, and select the best bidder for the contract.
Vendors can register and login to the system, view tender notifications, and submit their bids in an encrypted format.
The system uses blockchain to store the tender documents and bids in a distributed ledger, ensuring immutability and traceability of the transactions3.
The system uses AES encryption and SHA-1 hashing to secure the tender documents and bids, and to verify their authenticity.
The system uses an iterative model as the software development life cycle, and follows the UML diagrams and ER diagrams for the system design4.
The system uses Python, Flask, MySQL, and Pandas for the implementation, and provides a user-friendly web interface for the users.


## Tech Stack

**Client:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Server:** MySQL, Python, Flask Framework



## Installation and Usage
To run the system, you need to have Python 3, Flask, MySQL, and Pandas installed on your machine. You also need to create a database named “smart_tender” and import the SQL file provided in the repository. Then, you can run the app.py file to start the Flask server and access the system on your browser.

The system has two types of users: tender officers and bidders. You can use the following credentials to login as a tender officer:

Email: tenderofficer@gmail.com
Password: tender123
Secret key: tender
You can use the following credentials to login as a bidder:

Email: bidder@gmail.com
Password: bidder123
Secret key: bidder
Alternatively, you can register as a new user with your own email and password.

Once logged in, you can use the navigation menu to access the different features of the system, such as creating or viewing tender notifications, submitting or downloading bids, viewing results, and making payments. You can also logout from the system when you are done.
